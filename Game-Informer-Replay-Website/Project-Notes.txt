TO-DO:

12/20/19

- TODO: Reset video player to cue first 200 episodes of selectedEpisodes
only when NOT videoPlayer.PlayerState.CUED

- TODO: Use setter for search and filter that sorts order, changes 
page number, and updates displayed elements

- ISSUE: When searching for text, sortByType() is run and reverses array
again

12/17/19

- TODO: Page Select: Prev-First-BackN-(i-m)-(i-1)-i-(i+1)-(i+m)-ForwardN-Last-Next
N: skip forward/backward n episodes where n is proportional 
to totalPages() or maxDisplayedEpisodes

- ISSUE: 'See Also' links have wrong url beginnings. Also, list 'See Also'
links after 'External Links' and display them as two columns for wider
screens.

- ISSUE: MaxDisplayedEpisodes 'All' is not correctly
loaded on refresh

- Web Scraper: Some 'See Also' headlines have a single link
in a paragraph element instead of ul li list.

- Ignore Video headline in episodeMoreInfo element.
Don't scrape in Python web scraper.

- When search with empty text input, reset selectedEpisodes
list to include all episodes and apply sort/filter

X Do NOT load YouTube playlist if selectedEpisodes is empty
OR load Replay Highlights instead.

12/16/19

- ISSUE: Searching through GI article can lead to 
non-relevant search result.
SOLUTION: Ignore GI article when searching each replay
episode.

- ISSUE: When search returns zero results, check for errors
and number of displayed episodes is not reset.

12/15/19

X ISSUE: Web Scraper: If Fandom wiki page contains multiple Game Informer
links, only the last is scraped and saved. Change to only first link
is scraped.

- Ignore headings in More Info that have no content

- Add MIT License. Review other license options.

- Use element.hidden instead of display to hide Next and Prev
buttons as well as episode template perhaps.

- Sort Container: Put select elements inside label element
and remove id and for attributes since they become unnecessary.

12/12/19

- Filter Options: Air Date (Year)

- Add gameData section that details the games played in the episode.
On larger screens, float section to the right inside moreInfo and
the other content floats around it. On smaller screens, add to
bottom of moreInfo as a block section NOT floated. Use scroll
wheel for overflow. Use game scraper to get data about games
including small thumbnail image.

X Web Scraper: Scrape each game informer article for title, author,
date posted, array of strings for article content.

- Web Scraper: Use JS YouTube API to get view count, likes, 
dislikes.

- Filter: Add fieldsets for each filter type and fill those with
options found with functions (ex. host/featuring function that
lists each host/guest and counts their appearances). Sort order
of each fieldset is the number of appearances.

- Add overflow:hidden properties for moreInfo so only first part
of description is shown before clicking a bar underneath to display
rest of moreInfo.

X VideoPlayer: load playlist of selectedEpisodes youTube ID's
whenever it changes.

X Pages: Add pages functionality to display multiple pages
depending on maxDislayedEpisodes.

12/8/19

- ISSUE: Alex Kidd Enchanted Castle
Editor Antics paragraph not added from web scrape

X ISSUE: When changing maxDisplayedEpisodes, entire list is 
removed from display before adding new list. 
SOLUTION: Add/remove only required episodes from display, leaving
other episode sections alone. OR current solution is quick enough
and avoids potential problems from proposed solution.

12/6/19

- Display game titles in details with limit. For episodes with long
lists of games played, show first number of characters in the game
title list string ending with ellipsis. By clicking on the ellipsis,
the rest of the game title string is displayed.

PRE - 12/6/19

- When youtube video starts, move episode list so the episode
description/details is directly below the video player allowing
the viewer immediate access to all the relevant information about
the episode.

- Show a portion of the description at the bottom of each main
section of each episode. Right below is a button to expand the
tab to reveal all the information available about the episode.
Have option to expand/close all episode sections at once.

- YouTube API:
As an extra security measure, you should also include the origin 
parameter to the URL, specifying the URL scheme (http:// or https://) 
and full domain of your host page as the parameter value. 
While origin is optional, including it protects against malicious 
third-party JavaScript being injected into your page and hijacking 
control of your YouTube player.

X ISSUE: Square thumbnail images are too big
Fix thumbnail images to display in constant image ratio for
more current widescreen ration. If older square ratios, shrink
to appropriate height and fill side gaps with black bars.
