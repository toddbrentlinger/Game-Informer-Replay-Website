lists of games played, show first number of characters in the game
title list string ending with ellipsis. By clicking on the ellipsis,
the rest of the game title string is displayed.

PRE - 12/6/19

- When youtube video starts, move episode list so the episode
description/details is directly below the video player allowing
the viewer immediate access to all the relevant information about
the episode.

- Show a portion of the description at the bottom of each main
section of each episode. Right below is a button to expand the
tab to reveal all the information available about the episode.
Have option to expand/close all episode sections at once.

- YouTube API:
As an extra security measure, you should also include the origin 
parameter to the URL, specifying the URL scheme (http:// or https://) 
and full domain of your host page as the parameter value. 
While origin is optional, including it protects against malicious 
third-party JavaScript being injected into your page and hijacking 
control of your YouTube player.

- ISSUE: Square thumbnail images are too big
Fix thumbnail images to display in constant image ratio for
more current widescreen ration. If older square ratios, shrink
to appropriate height and fill side gaps with black bars.
